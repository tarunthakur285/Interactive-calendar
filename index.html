                <p>"Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work. I live by that. You grind hard so you can play hard. At the end of the day, you put all the work in, and eventually will pay off. It could be in a year, it could be in 30year. Eventually, your hard work will pay off."</p>
                <h1>✦Thoughts✦</h1>
                <p>Obviously, we are not saying that it is possible to be happy all of the time. But many people manage to live in an overall state of happiness. But how do we achieve this? When life feels overwhelmingly negative, it is easy to lose sight of how important happiness is. Most of the time people are not even aware, that they are the root of their own unhappiness.</p>
                <h1>✦Tips for healthy start✦</h1>
                <p>Fats consumed should be less than 30% of your total energy intake. This will help prevent unhealthy weight gain and NCDs. There are different types of fats, but unsaturated fats are preferable over saturated fats and trans-fats. WHO recommends reducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake; reducing trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake; and replacing both saturated fats and trans-fats to unsaturated fats.</p>
